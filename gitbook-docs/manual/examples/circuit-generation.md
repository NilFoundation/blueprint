# Circuit Generation

Circuit generation consist of two steps: compiling the code into Intermediate Representation and assigning the values to the variables of the execution trace. The first step is done by the clang/rustc compiler and the second step is done by the assigner binary.

Before progressing further, please ensure you have setup the [environment](../../guides/environment-setup.md) and followed the [installation](../../guides/installation.md) guide.
