# Proof Verification

Proof verification can be done locally or can be done in on chain smart contracts. Proof verification process is not handled by zkLLVM , though mentioned here as the circuit developer is still responsible to publish the onchain verifier contracts and wrappers. The onchain verification flow is managed by the lorem-ipsum project.

The users/applications , will retrieve the proof generated by the counter party from the proof market. The proof can be verified inside EVM by dApps.

As we see above, the dApp will have a API exposed which will take details such as circuit address (circuit specific gates), public inputs and the proof. This smart contract will verify the proof for the circuit by leveraging both the placeholder verifier and the circuit specific logic verifiers.
