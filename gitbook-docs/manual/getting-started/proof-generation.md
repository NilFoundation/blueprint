# Proof Producer

Proof generation may be a resource-demanding process. It is recommended to use a machine with at least 32GB of RAM and 8 cores. But instead of generating the proof by himself, one can use [proof market ](https://proof.market)to order a proof generation. The interaction with the proof market is done via [it's toolchain](https://github.com/NilFoundation/proof-market-toolchain), which is a set of scripts that automate the process of proof ordering.
