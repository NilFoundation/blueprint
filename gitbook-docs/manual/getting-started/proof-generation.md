# Proof Producer

Proof generation may be a resource-demanding process. A machine with at least 32GB of RAM and 8 cores is recommended. But instead of generating the proof by users, they can send an order to the [proof market ](https://proof.market)for a proof generation. The interaction with the proof market is done via its[ toolchain](https://github.com/NilFoundation/proof-market-toolchain), which is a set of scripts that automate the process of proof ordering.
