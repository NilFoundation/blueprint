# Circuit Developer

Before progressing further, please ensure you have setup the [environment](../../guides/environment-setup.md) and followed the [installation](../../guides/installation.md) guide.



## Flow

### 1. Compile Circuit

A circuit developer write his circuit in a high level language of his choice (C++/Rust). This circuit is next compiled using the `clang` compiler generated by zkLLVM. This step outputs a \*ll file which is an intermediate representation of the circuit.

### 2. Publish Circuit (Proof Market)

The generated IR can be pushed to the proof market. This enables Proof requester & generators to serve each other. The process to publish circuits is handled by the proof market project.



### 3. Publish On chain verifiers (ex: EVM)

The circuit developer will also be generating the smart contracts for the circuits they have created. This will enable on-chain verification of the proof. The smart contracts consist of gate representations of the circuit. These contracts work in conjunction with the `placeholder` proof validation smart contracts. The process to transpile the circuit into smart contracts is handled by the lorem-ipsum project.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
EVM is one of the first supported protocols. The transpiler will be extended to generate verification in other VMs.
