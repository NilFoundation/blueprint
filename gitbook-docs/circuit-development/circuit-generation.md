# Circuit Developer

The best entry point to start the circuit development process is our [template repository](). It contains a Dockerfile with all the dependencies installed. It also contains a sample circuit that you can use to get started.

In case if you don't want to use Docker, you can install the compiler manually. It can be done by following the [installation](../getting-started/installation.md) guide.

Once you've installed the compiler or built the Docker image - you can start writing your circuit.

## Flow

### 1. Compile Circuit

A circuit developer writes his circuit in a high-level language of his choice (C++/Rust). This circuit is next compiled using the `clang` compiler generated by zkLLVM. This step outputs a `*ll` file, an intermediate representation of the circuit.

### 2. Publish Circuit (Proof Market)

The generated IR can be pushed to the proof market. This enables Proof requesters & generators to serve each other. The proof market project handles the process of publishing circuits.



### 3. Publish On chain verifiers (ex: EVM)

The circuit developer will also be generating smart contracts for the circuits they have created. This will enable on-chain verification of the proof. The smart contracts consist of gate representations of the circuit. These contracts work in conjunction with the `placeholder` proof validation smart contracts. The lorem-ipsum project handles the process to transpile the circuit into smart contracts.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
EVM is one of the first supported protocols. The transpiler will be extended to generate verification in other VMs.
